# Corn Cob Puppies (Corn Dogs)

## This is my own tried and true original corn dog recipe that I have tweaked and modified to my own personal taste. If you like fair dogs, you will love these! After cooking, place corn dog on a towel on a paper plate or wrap in a towel, top with mustard or ketchup, and enjoy!

## Ingredients:
- 8  bun-length hot dogs (such as GwaltneyÂ® Bun Sized Jumbo Franks)- 1 quart vegetable oil for frying
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup corn meal
- 1 cup buttermilk
- 2  large eggs
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 2 tablespoons bacon drippings
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 pinch garlic powder
- 8  sturdy bamboo skewers


## Directions:
- Place hot dogs into a large pot of simmering water and keep hot- Heat vegetable oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)
- Whisk flour, corn meal, buttermilk, eggs, sugar, bacon drippings, salt, baking powder, and garlic powder in a large bowl until moistened; beat batter until smooth, 2 to 3 minutes
- Remove a hot dog from the water and blot completely dry with paper towels; skewer the hot dog lengthwise with a bamboo skewer
- Using the skewer end as a handle, roll the hot dog in the batter to thoroughly coat
- Roll the corn dog in the hot oil with the same continuous rolling motion, setting the batter; continue to roll the corn dog in the hot oil until deep golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes
- Alternately, lay corn dog into hot oil after initial rolling to finish cooking the batter, about 1 minute per side
- Drain corn dogs on paper towels to blot excess oil
